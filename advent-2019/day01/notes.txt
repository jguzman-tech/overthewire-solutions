In this lab your task is to decode these .csv files that a keylogger records and
get the text message that were sent. The .csv files have only two columns, the
first column is a timestamp, and the second is a keypad code. 

keys.h tells you how the keypad codes are recorded. It's kind of confusing at
first but imagine that Santa, the sender of these texts is using one of those
old flip phones. In those phones you had to repeatedly press a key to cycle
through letters and until you stopped pressing the same key. It's the same idea
here. I initially tried writing a solution in c with read_sequence.c but decided
to switch to python with read_sequence.py. Python is more familiar to me and
quicker to program with. 

My code didn't figure out how to parse the same date as the example smsX.txt
files but this was not necessary for retrieving the flag. Reading my code and
comments within that will give you more details. Running:

python3 read_sequence.py sms4.csv

gave me this output:

date: 1999-11-23 03:38:06
to: 00611015550117
