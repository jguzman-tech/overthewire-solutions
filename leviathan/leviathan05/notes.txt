Again the decompilation was not helpful.

Here is an example of how you can set a memory address to a string in gdb:

set {char [40]} 0x8048722 = "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6"

I think I may just lookup the password at this point. The only input that I can
see for the program is from the contents is from /tmp/file.log. In that file
a filestream is opened and each character is read and then immediately
printed. I as leviathan5 do not have reading rights to
/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 but the leviathan5 executable does since the
setuid bit is set. But I don't see how I can redirect the executable to open the
password file. I am just lost at this point.

The answer turned out to be creating a symlink which just requires a single
command:

ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log

And then of course running the executable again.

A symlink is analogous to a shortcut.

https://jhalon.github.io/over-the-wire-leviathan/ was again the resource that I
used.
