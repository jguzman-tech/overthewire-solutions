This was the easiest lab so far for me. All I did was cd into the .trash
directory cat the bin file and use the following link to convert the binary
strings to ascii text:

The output was: Tith4cokei which is the password for the next lab

Note: for some strange reason I cannot open dired through tramp for leviathan5

leviathan5 password: Tith4cokei
