Hurray, I was actually able to solve this one without looking up a solution!

All that was required was running the program once with ltrace:

ltrace ./level3

Then examing the strcmp and:

./level3
password: snlprintf
cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3

Remember that like gdb ltrace does not get the owner's permissions even if
the setuid bit is set.
