As with the previous wargame I used Ctrl+U to view source. This time there was
nothing but a pixel.png file was I didn't notice when viewing the page. Viewing
this image showed nothing exciting. It was indeed just a single pixel. I even
tried downloading it thinking maybe there was some metadata containing the
password.

I did notice that the pixel.png file was within a ./files folder. When I opened
this I saw that there was a file called users.txt. I found the password there.
