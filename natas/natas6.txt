In this lab you are greeted with a form labeled "Input secret:" and a link to
"View sourcecode". Using Ctrl+U won't help you here but when you click on the
view sourcecode link you can see the php code that's executed for the post
request submitted by the form.

At the top of the php snippet you will see:

include "includes/secret.inc"

You can open this file on your browser to view the secret by visiting:
