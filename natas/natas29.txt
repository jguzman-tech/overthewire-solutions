In this web page you're given a form where you can select one of 5 different
perl files to view. When you select an option the perl is loaded into the web
page. The perl code does not looks useful and it's a ton to read. It looks like
there are jokes and irc chat messages mixed into the code. 

It looks like I've hit the limit of my knowledge with natas challenges
27-29. This lab requires you to know perl. I could tell that the page is using
perl to open local files but did not know how you could inject pipes into
perl. I've never used perl before. I also noticed that the web page was
filtering "natas" literally. Since I tried visiting:
http://natas29.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.pl?file=/etc/natas_webpass/natas30
and it responded with "meeeeep!".
