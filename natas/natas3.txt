I tried looking at the source for the page this time and there was nothing but
the comment:

<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->

I tried looking at cookies, checking the ./files/ directory. Comparing this page
with the previous page, looking at the .css and .js files from the header even
though they are out-of-scope.

I looked it up here:

So the comment is supposed to tip you off that you should check the robots.txt
file which is used by web crawlers. I did not know about this file. But when you
read it, it tells you about the ./s3cr3t/ directory. This directory contains
users.txt which has the natas4 password.
