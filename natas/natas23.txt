In this lab you are given a webpage with a form where you enter a
password. You're given a link to source code again. In the source code you'll
see that it will print the password for the next level if the following
condition is met:

strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"],"iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] > 10 )

I initially tried "iloveyouaaa" since that contains the "iloveyou" substring and
has a length longer than 10. This didn't work. I looked up the strstr function
and it does check if a substring exists. But string to int comparisons are weird
in php. Apparently, all strings that don't start with a number evaluate to 0,
and if it does start with a number than the value is that number. See this link:
