In this lab you are given just a webpage with a source code link and nothing
else. If you look at the source code you'll see the following php snippets.

<?
session_start();

if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    // only admins can reveal the password
    if(!($_SESSION and array_key_exists("admin", $_SESSION) and $_SESSION["admin"] == 1)) {
    header("Location: /");
    }
}
?>

<?
    if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    print "You are an admin. The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
    print "<pre>Username: natas23\n";
    print "Password: <censored></pre>";
    }
?>

So, the only way to get the password seems to be if you have the $_GET key named
revelio and a $SESSION key named admin equal to 1. It's not possible for us to
set this session variable since there's no way to inject keys into the session.

I searched online for a hint and saw this link:
https://n0j.github.io/2017/03/22/otw-natas-22.html. This user used the burp
suite for a local-proxy, which is overkill for this assignment.

It turns out that the code after the header() call is still executing because
you're supposed to put exit() afterwards. But in your browser you're given the
redirect so you don't see the password. I opened wireshark with "ip.addr ==
176.9.9.172" as a filter. This is the ip address of the lab website. I saw the
password in the first http response from the server after visiting
http://natas22.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?revelio=1 in my browser.

I did think about using curl before, this would have also solved the problem
since it doesn't redirect pages like a normal browser.

The curl command:

curl -u natas22:chG9fbe1Tq2eWVMgjYYD1MsfIvN461kJ 'http://natas22.natas.labs.overthewire.org?revelio=1'

natas23 password: D0vlad33nQF0Hz2EP255TP5wSW9ZsRSE
