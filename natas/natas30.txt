This was another tricky lab. You really need to have some perl experience to be
able to complete it. In this lab you are given a web form where you can enter a
username and password. You are also given some source code. The logic of the
source code looked sound. If you are able to correctly guess the password then
the webpage will give you the password for natas31.

We know at least that there is a user named natas31 in the database. The
vulnerability in this case would have to be something involving
sql-injection. The DBI::quote method is supposed to safely escape characters for
the query. This link showed me how to solve the lab:
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/175703/is-this-perl-database-connection-vulnerable-to-sql-injection.

Ludisposed explains it best but the flaw here is that perl's param function can
return an array. So we can provide multiple password arguments to bypass this
web page.

I used this curl command to obtain the password:

curl -u natas30:wie9iexae0Daihohv8vuu3cei9wahf0e -d "username=natas31&password='lol' or 1&password=2" http://natas30.natas.labs.overthewire.org

natas31 password: hay7aecuungiuKaezuathuk9biin0pu1
