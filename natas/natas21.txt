When you visit the site for this lab you are told that you're logged in as a
regular user and that you must login as an admin to receive the natas22
password. You are also given a link for a colocated website and some source
code.

The source code shows nothing useful. It just prints out the natas22 password if
you have the cookie of an admin much like the last several levels. However, the
colocated website has a web form which may be exploitable.

Since the website are colocated they are hosted on the same machine. This means
a phpsession should be accessible from one to the other. The colocated website
has a css experimentor where you enter some form values and the css of the page
will change, and this change is saved on the server with a phpsessid. You are
given the code for this colocated website.

The code for the colocated website is insecure because it will write whatever
parameters are given to the $SESSION. I used inspect element to change one of
the form input names to admin and set the value to 1. I then submitted this form
and copied the key to the other tab were I had the main lab website, using the
EditThisCookie browser extension. When I reloaded the page, I retrieved the
password.
