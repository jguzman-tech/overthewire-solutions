In this lab you are given a web form where you upload a CSV file and the web
page formats it in html for you. I have found several solutions online that
reference
https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Rubin-The-Perl-Jam-2-The-Camel-Strikes-Back.pdf
which talks about a perl cgi vulnerability. Perl does not safely handle file
uploads. This is a vulnerability built into the cgi library and cannot be fixed
with safer programming techniques. 

I've really hit my limit here. I searched up some solutions but I could not find
one that doesn't use burp suite which I've never used before. I guess it's time
for me to download burp suite.

I followed the natas31 example provided at this link:

Once I installed burp suite community edition all I had to do was click the
repeater tab and paste the POST request from the link into the raw text field
and hit send.
