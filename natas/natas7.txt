In this challenge the page only contains two links. But they don't lead to
anywhere interesting, just identical pages. If you view source with Ctrl+U you
can see a comment that says the password is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8. This
makes sense once you see the link source:

<a href="index.php?page=home">Home</a>

So I inspected element and changed home to /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 and then
clicked this link to get the password.

natas8 password: DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe
