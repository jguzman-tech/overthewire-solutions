This lab had the same setup as natas6. I clicked view source and saw that the
php snippet is comparing the string "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362" with the
text you enter into the form. But the form input is being passed through this
function first:

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

I created my own decode function and executed a small php script on my local
machine.

<?php
$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";
function decodeSecret($code) {
    return base64_decode(strrev(pack("H*",$code)));
}
$decodedSecret = decodeSecret($encodedSecret);
echo decodeSecret($encodedSecret) . "\n";

The output of this was oubWYf2kBq which is the correct passphrase for the page.
