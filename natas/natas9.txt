The webpage for this lab looks like it's doing simple dictionary searches. But
if you click on the view source link you'll see that the webpage is executing a
shell command with:

passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");

However, it does not filter $key, which the user sets via form input. So we
can inject shell code by prepending whatever command we want with a semicolon.

I messed around for quite a while trying to find out what I could do. The
solution in this case is to cat the password. All the passwords are located in
the /etc/natas_webpass/ directory. I was confused as there is also a
/etc/natas_pass/ directory but I couldn't access it. If you run a command that
natas9 does not have permission to run you cannot see the errors in the webpage.

I was able to obtain the password by running:

""; ls -lah /etc/natas_webpass; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;

Although now I know that the quotes at the beginning, and of course the ls
command were unnecessary.

natas10 password: nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu
