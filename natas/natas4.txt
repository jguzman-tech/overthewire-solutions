This was a tricky one. The page clearly tells you what to do though. It tells
you that it knows you came from the url "" when you need to come from
http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org in order to access the page. After some
googling I learned that this means you need to change the referrer. There are
several ways to do this but they are all blocked on modern browsers to prevent
abuse. The referrer was "" for me because I pasted the url into my browser so I
wasn't "referred" by any webpage. I tried adding a meta tag to the page and then
I tried using the JavaScript console but these methods were blocked in both
Google Chrome and Firefox. I even tried using curl but I couldn't figure out how
to get past the JavaScript password prompt.

The solution that I came up with is going to that url:
http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org hitting cancel on the dialogue box and
then using inspect element to insert the link into the page. When I clicked this
link I am quite literally coming form the specified url so I was given the
password.

I did download a referrer editor browser extension but then thought of the above
which seemed like a nice low-tech solution.
