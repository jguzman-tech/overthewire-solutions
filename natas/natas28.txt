You are given a web page where you can enter text into a form and it will search
for matches of your string in a joke database. To do this it redirects you to a
search.php page. It contains a query field in the url query string. We know that
this value is encrypted. When I entered the following URL to my web browser it
responded with "Incorrect amount of PKCS#7 padding for blocksize":

http://natas28.natas.labs.overthewire.org/search.php/?query=

I knew for sure that the SQL query would look something like "SELECT * FROM
<table> WHERE <joke-field> LIKE '%<user-input>%' ORDER BY RANDOM"

I gathered this because it was clear that quotes and other special characters
were properly escaped. The following are some URL and query field results.

Notice how each query value starts with
"G+glEae6W/1XjA7vRm21nNyEco/c+J2TdR0Qp8dcjPK". I learned that this means ECB
encryption is being used. Which means that each block of text is encrypted
individually. I was lost on how to proceed from this point. I was able to obtain
the password with code provided by the owner of this blog
https://blog.anshumanonline.com/natas29/. He can explain it better than I can. I
could not have obtained the password on my own.
