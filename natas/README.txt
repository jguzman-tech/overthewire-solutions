This directory contains my solutions to the challenges provided on
https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas. Each challenge involves entering the
username with the correct password in the respective urls that take the form
http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, for natas0 through natas34.

This set of labs are focused on server-side web security.

Starting with natas10 I try to provide more insight into my thought process and
what missteps I took. This is a more informative approach and provides more
thorough documentation for my own record.
