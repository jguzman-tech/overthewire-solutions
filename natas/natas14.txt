In this lab you are greeted to another simple form along with a link to view the
source code as is usual. You are asked to enter in a username and password. If
you enter a wrong password you'll be given an Access Denied message after
submitting the form.

If you look at the source code you'll see this code for the sql query in the
backend:

$query = "SELECT * from users where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\" and
password=\"".$_REQUEST["password"]."\"";

You'll notice that there is no input validation for this query. The code just
checks that the number of selected rows is greater than 0 before giving us the
natas15 password. So, it is ripe for sql injection. I tried a couple queries, it
seemed like comments weren't working so I created a tautology for both username
and password by submitting:

OR "1" = "1

The query which is executed will be this:

SELECT * FROM users where username="" OR "1" = "1" and password="" OR "1" = "1"

The "1" = "1" is true for every row in the database so all the rows will be
selected by the query.

natas15 password: AwWj0w5cvxrZiONgZ9J5stNVkmxdk39J
