When you log into natas5 the page says that you're disallowed because you're not
logged in. As we should all know websites keep track of whether you're logged in
or not through cookies stored on your local computer.

I checked the cookies by opening the JavaScript console and entering
"document.cookie". One of the cookies that I could see was
"loggedin=0". Changing the value of document.cookie is sadly also blocked by
default in Google Chrome. I downloaded a Google Chrome extension called
EditThisCookie and changed the value of loggedin to 1. After this I reloaded the
page in order to get the password.
