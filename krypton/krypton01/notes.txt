There are only two files located in /krypton/krypton1 they are:

README and krypton2

README is just an intro message. It tells to try these krypton exercising
without using "cryptool first". I've never heard of cryptool, it would be good
to learn. It also says that krypton2 contains ROT13 cyphertext.

The code I used to solve this lab is in decypher.py.

Technically decyphering and cyphering is done with exactly the same process so
decypher.py is a misnomer. Example: The ascii value of A is 65, plus 13 is 78 (N), plus 13
again is 91 so we wrap back around to 65 (A).

krypton2 password: ROTTEN
