The README tells us that this is another polyalphabetic cipher but the key size
is unknown...

I tried immediately using the tool at
http://www.cryptoprograms.com/subsolve/periodic again without processing the
text at all. I couldn't assist the tool by lining up all of the text. After a
minute it seemed like it was cycling through some anagrams but then I saw the
guess "KEYLENGTH" come up and I paused the program. The keys and passwords for
these labs are often cryptography related so I used that key on just the
krypton6 file.

krypton6 password: RANDOM
