The README tells is that the last few cyphers have been monoalphabetic. But this
one will be polyalphabetic, a Vigenère Cypher.

A Vigenère Cypher is actually pretty simple. Your key will be a string. You
cycle through this string and add each character to the plaintext (with
wraparound), and that's it. Here's a simple example from the README.

P     15 17 14 2  4  4  3 12  4 4  19  8 13 6  0  18 0  6 17 4 4   3
K     6  14 11 3  6 14 11  3  6 14 11  3  6 14 11  3 6 14 11 3 6  14
C     21 5  25 5 10 18 14 15 10 18  4 11 19 20 11 21 6 20  2 8 10 17

We are given three cyphertext files they are found1, found2, and krypton5. The
README also tells us the key length is 5.

The HINT file tells us that we should still be using Frequency Analysis but we
should treat it as 6 different mono-alphabetic cyphers. So we won't immediately
be able to read words. It will be much harder to do by hand, but it looks like
we are given plenty of sample text. It will take persistence...

By hand I don't care to do this. Making a tool to crack this would be cool
though. I'm using the tool at: http://www.cryptoprograms.com/subsolve/periodic

I'll need to comebine all of the text though. I'll do that in a python
script. The script combined all three files and I filled gaps with
"X". Thankfully the sample size was large enough to not throw off the tool. The
key was "FREKEY" and the password for krypton 5 is "CLEARTEXT".
