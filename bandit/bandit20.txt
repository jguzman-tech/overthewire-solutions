What I did:

I opened up two terminals. On the first I started listening on port 12345 with
this command:

<prompt>$ nc -l -p 12345

On the second terminal I executed:

<prompt>$ ./suconnect 12345

Then on the first terminal I entered the password for bandit20. After a couple
seconds of delay I saw the bandit21 message get printed from the first
terminal.

The trick here is to pay very close attention to the wording of the message
provided by running ./suconnect with no arguments: "This program will connect to
the given port on localhost using TCP. If it receives the correct password from
the other side, the next password is transmitted back." The suconnect is the
"client" and you have to provide a "server" for this lab which can be done by
using nc with the listen option. This tripped me up for a while.
