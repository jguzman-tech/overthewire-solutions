What I did:

This link showed me how to use the openssl commands:
https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html

I used this one based on the link: "openssl s_client -connect
localhost:30001". I then typed the bandit15 password into the terminal and it
gave me the new password. 

bandit 16 password: cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
