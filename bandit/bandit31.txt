What I did:

When you git clone this repo the README.md this time said that you have to push
a file key.txt with contents "May I come in?". So I created the key.txt file
then added it with:

git add key.txt

There was an error message because of my .gitignore so I removed the *.txt
rule. After this I was able to add key.txt. Then I committed my changes with:

git commit -a

Finally I pushed with:

git push origin master

When I ran this command the remote responded with the password.
