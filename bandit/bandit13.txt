What I did:

We are given the ssh private key of bandit14. So the whole task here is really
just to figure out how to ssh into a server by specifying a non-default private
key and then to read the /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 file to get the password. I
logged into the server as bandit 14 with:

ssh -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost

It took me a couple attempts. Because I couldn't resolve the hostname
bandit.labs.overthewire.org and I didn't realize that I needed the -o
"IdentitiesOnly=yes" option there to override the default private key. A third
quick thing was that it wouldn't let me use port 2220 to connect like it does
for logging into the bandit server from my local device, so I had to take off
the -p 2220 option.
