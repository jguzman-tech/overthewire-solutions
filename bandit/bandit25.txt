What I did:

You are given the key for bandit26 in the home directory of bandit25. I explain
how to do this in my bandit16 write-up but here's the command:

ssh -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost

This host instantly logs you out each time after displaying the welcome message.

Initially I googled how to execute single commands through an ssh connection but
this had no effect. The shell in use by the bandit26 host is really just a more
command. This link helped me out:
https://medium.com/@coturnix97/overthewires-bandit-25-26-shell-355d78fd2f4d. A
good tip for future labs is using the following command to find out the default
shell of a user:

cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26

I'll let the link explain the rest. But for accessing a terminal in bandit26
know that you need to hit v to enter vi, enter :set shell=/bin/bash to the vi
command-line, and then :shell.

I was not a fan of this lab. In what real-world situation would anyone make a
login shell like this? Sure, it required some out of the box thinking since I
would have kept trying to execute bash or powershell commands.
