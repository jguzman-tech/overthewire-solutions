What I did:

This was a very simple lab. All you had to do was clone the repository. I made a
directory within /tmp/ in the bandit server then cloned the repo with:

git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo

After this I read the file ./repo/README which contained the password.
