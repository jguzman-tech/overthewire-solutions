What I did:

./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

To run a binary in linux you just need to specify the directory where it's
located. So if it's in your current directory you do need the ./ in front. The
message the executable provided when ran with no arguments was:

bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
bandit19@bandit:~$

This message made me think that it required a userid or username as an
argument. No you just provide any command as an argument and it will be run as
user bandit20. I used cat on the file which contains the bandit20 password which
is only accessible to bandit20.

bandit20 password: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
