This directory contains my solutions to the challenges provided on
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html

Each challenge involves logging into ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port
2220 as bandit0 through bandit34. The password for bandit0 is bandit0 and to get
the password of the next bandit you must find the password through various
challenges which require bash/linux knowledge.

The challenges don't start getting interesting until bandit5.
