What I did:

for x in `cat bandit11_data.txt`
do echo `echo $x | tr a-z n-za-m | tr A-Z N-ZA-M`
done

This is a small example and you're given the letter rotation number you could do
by hand or better yet with python which you do have access to on the server. I
wanted to figure out the bash way to do it. This post on stackoverflow helped
me:

tr command here is used to replace ranges of characters with another.
