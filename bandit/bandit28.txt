What I did:

Like for the last bandit lab I made a directory within tmp and then cloned the
repo with:

git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo

I read the README.md file and this time it's password was redacted. My first
thought was maybe there is another branch I could checkout that has the
password. There were no other branches so I checked the git log with the "git
log" command. This showed me there were commits. I checked them out using their
commit hashes with:

git checkout <some-hash>

Once you checkout a commit you can explore the repo again which in this case
contains only a README.md file. It turned out that there was a password "leak"
in the 2nd commit. One of the commiters was named "Ben Dover", very funny.
