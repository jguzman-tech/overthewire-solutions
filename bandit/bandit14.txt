What I did:

This was a very quick task for me. I had used the nc command before all this lab
required was:

bandit14@bandit:~$ echo "4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e" | nc localhost 30000
Correct!

bandit14@bandit:~$

You can echo strings and pipe them into nc to send it to the specified host and
port number.
