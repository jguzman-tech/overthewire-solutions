What I did:

This took me several attempts. I did not realize that using * with ls does not
match files that start with periods. I was trying to use "ls -lah
./maybehere*/*" which skipped over all the hidden inner files. So I used "find *
-size 1033c". Which gave me the output "maybehere07/.file2". I catted this file
to get the bandit6 password.

bandit6 password: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
