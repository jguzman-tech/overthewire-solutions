What I did:

The other git labs were very quick for me but I was stuck on this one. There are
no branches or commits to look at to view the password for this lab. This link
showed me how to get the password in this case:

Unbeknownst to me, git has a tagging feature. Tags are usually used to save old
commits. I have a little experience with git from my internship but we never
used tags as far as I know.
