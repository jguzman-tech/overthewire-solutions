What I did:

I made my own directory as suggested by the prompt in the tmp directory. This
lab required first getting the raw data from the hexdump then getting into a
loop of checking the file type (with command "file <some-file>") and then
decompressing the file. I believe it took 8 steps of decompression and the
details of the commands are not too important. There was a mixture of gzip,
bzip2, and tar compression. I knew that I was done when the file command gave me
the output: "data8.bin: ASCII text".
