What I did:

The work for this one was identical to bandit19 once you access the terminal as
described in my bandit25 explanation. You simply run bandit27-do with a command
behind it. It will be run with bandit27 rights so you can just cat the next
password with:

./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27

bandit27 password: 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
