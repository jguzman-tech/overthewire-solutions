What I did:

I went into the /etc/cron.d/ directory and saw that there was a file called
cronjob_bandit22. The files contents were:

@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

So I read the /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh file. The contents of the script was
as follows:

#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

I then read the /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv file. It contained only
one line with the password.
