What I did:

I used this link as a source:

https://medium.com/secttp/overthewire-bandit-level-31-e3b82064285a

The shell converts all input to uppercase which is a big problem because
the shell commands are case sensitive. This link showed me that I could enter
"$0" into the terminal to reset it so that it's a normal sh shell again. After
this you can just cat the password file for the next level. The $0 variable
stores the shell name. $0 does not contain any letters that can be converted to
upper case by the shell so entering $0 is like executing the command "sh" which
resets the terminal in this case.

This was the last lab in the bandit series as of 11/08/2019.
