What I did:

This was very quick. My initial thought was to cat the whole file and then use
grep to filter for the word "millionth" but I first checked the size of the file
with "ls -lah data.txt". This told me the file size was 4.0 MB. My only concern
was execution speed but 4.0 MB is still small so I executed "cat data.txt | grep
millionth" to get the password.
