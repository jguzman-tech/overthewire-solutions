What I did:

This was a very tough lab. I was able to solve it after getting hints from other
players. It was kind of funny, we were creating directories with messages in the
file name to communicate, since everyone has permission to create files in that
directory. The prompt was the same as the last two labs. You view the cronjob by
reading the /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24 file. Then you see that it executes a
single script called /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh. Then you read that shell
script. Here is the script:

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
	echo "Handling $i"
	timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
	rm -f ./$i
    fi
done

As you can see it's iterating through all the files within the
/var/spool/bandit24 directory, executing them, and then removing them. The key
to this lab is the fact that the cronjob is executing all scripts within the
directory so you can make your own script which writes /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24
to a file that you have access to. The cronjob runs as bandit24 so it has access
to the password file while you as user bandit23 don't.

I made this script:

#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 >> /tmp/my_dir/passwords

I had to quickly chmod 777 the script file in order for the cronjob to be able
to execute it. Because by default when I save a file in emacs it does not set
execution permissions.

I then used tail on the /tmp/my_dir/passwords file and waited for it to update
with the new password.
