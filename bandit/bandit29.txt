What I did:

I created a new directory within /tmp/ on the server and then cloned the repo
with:

git clone git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo

I checked the README.md file within the repo and it had a redacted password. The
git log showed only one other commit to master and it didn't have the password
either so I checked what branches there were with:

git branch -a

This listed all of the branches. When I checked out the remotes/origin/dev
branch I was able to view the password in ./repo/README.md. Remember that to use
git commands you need to be within the directory of the repository which in this
case is just repo folder.
