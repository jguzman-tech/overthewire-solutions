What I did:

I opened up a shell and used this command to iterate through the files and print
their contents within the ~/inhere directory:

for((i=0; i<10; i++)); do echo "./-file0$i"; cat "./-file0$i"; echo -e "\n"; done;

This is a bash for loop, I iterate through i values of 0 through 10 and cat each
filename, the file contents, and a new line.
